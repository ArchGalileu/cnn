###Camerata NovNorte

Camerata NovNorte is an orchestra of chamber of strings constituted by young instrumentalists of the North of Portugal

The work developed at Camerata NovNorte, directed by prof. Radu Ungureanu, focuses on the repertoire of all times of instrumental music, intended for this type of grouping. Its specific problematic, partially different from the problematic symphonic or chamber music, represents a complement in the formation of the instrumentalists.

In the preparation of the programs, individual technical skills are valued by placing them at the service of sound image construction and the improvement of musical expression required by the specificities of a small ensemble.

Among the characteristic notes of the Camerata NovNorte, virtuosity is emphasized - both by the repertoire options and by the interpretative attitude - and the care with the stylistic aspects.

The activity of Camerata NovNorte takes place in concerts in the north of the country: Porto, Braga, Vila Nova de Gaia, Espinho, etc.

The Camerata participated in festivals like FAN of Vila Real and Bragan√ßa, Portugal (2012), and FIMU of Belfort, France (2014 and 2017).

The orchestra made the recording for the soundtrack of the film "La revoyure" by Saguenail.
